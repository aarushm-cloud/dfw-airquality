# engine/features.py — Feature engineering: compute per-sensor traffic and wind columns
#
# Allow running this file directly for the __main__ verification block:
#   python engine/features.py
# When run as a script, Python puts engine/ on sys.path[0] instead of the project
# root, so "from engine.adjustments import ..." fails. The block below fixes that
# before any package imports happen.

#
#
# build_features() no longer modifies pm25. PurpleAir sensors already measure the
# real-world effects of nearby traffic and wind; applying another adjustment on top
# of the raw reading would double-count those effects.
#
# Instead, this function computes traffic and wind values PER SENSOR and stores them
# as separate columns. These columns are used for:
#   1. Live dashboard snapshots — stored in data/dashboard_snapshots.csv via
#      data/history.py:save_snapshot. (NOT the Phase 4 training set; that is built
#      separately by data/collect_training_data.py from historical PurpleAir data.)
#   2. The same adjustment logic is applied POST-IDW to grid cells in interpolation.py,
#      where IDW alone has no knowledge of roads or wind.
#
# The returned DataFrame keeps pm25 and pm25_raw untouched (pm25 is already
# EPA-corrected at the source for PurpleAir rows; pm25_raw is the uncorrected
# reading for PurpleAir and NaN for OpenAQ) and adds these feature columns:
#   traffic_factor      — exponential congestion factor (0–1) for the nearest road
#   wind_term           — signed wind adjustment (µg/m³) that would be subtracted
#   nearest_congestion  — raw congestion score of the nearest traffic sample point
#   distance_to_road_m  — metres to that traffic point
#   direction_factor    — signed wind direction alignment (-1 transport … +1 dispersal)
#   dispersal           — wind speed dispersal strength (0–1)
