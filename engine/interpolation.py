# engine/interpolation.py — IDW (Inverse Distance Weighting) interpolation
#
# For each point on a grid, computes a weighted average of all sensor PM2.5 values.
# Sensors closer to a grid point get more weight: weight = 1 / distance^IDW_POWER
# A search radius (IDW_SEARCH_RADIUS_DEG) limits which sensors contribute to each
# cell — distant sensors get zero weight rather than a tiny but nonzero pull.
# Result: a smooth PM2.5 surface over Dallas we can render as a heatmap.
#
# adjust_grid() is called AFTER run_idw() to apply traffic and wind corrections to
# each interpolated cell. Because IDW knows nothing about roads or wind, these
# adjustments belong here — not on the raw sensor readings (which already reflect
# real-world traffic and wind conditions at the sensor locations).

    Returns five 2D arrays of the same shape:

    `idw_hw_dist` is the IDW-weighted distance-to-nearest-highway across each
    cell's contributing sensors (metres); used by adjust_grid() to taper the
    traffic adjustment for cells whose dominant sensors already sit on a road.
    `confidence` is a 0.0–1.0 score per cell indicating how reliable the IDW
    estimate is: 1.0 means a sensor sits essentially on the cell, 0.0 means
    the cell is at (or beyond) IDW_SEARCH_RADIUS_DEG from any sensor and is
    relying on the global-mean fallback.
    grid_resolution controls grid density (200 = 200x200 points over Dallas).

    Changes vs Phase 3:
      - power is now IDW_POWER (3) from config, not hardcoded 2
      - longitude deltas are multiplied by LON_CORRECTION (cos 32.78°) before
        squaring so east-west distances aren't overstated by ~19%
      - sensors beyond IDW_SEARCH_RADIUS_DEG get zero weight for each cell;

    Apply traffic and wind adjustments to an interpolated grid post-IDW.

    IDW alone produces a smooth PM2.5 surface based only on sensor proximity.
    This step adds the road-level and wind context that IDW cannot infer:
      - Grid cells near congested roads get a positive PM2.5 boost.
      - Grid cells downwind of traffic sources get an additional boost;
        cells upwind get a dispersal reduction.

    The same exponential traffic curve and cosine wind direction logic used
    in features.py is applied here, but fully vectorised with NumPy so that
    the entire 200×200 grid is processed in one set of array operations
