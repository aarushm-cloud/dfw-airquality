# data/ingestion/history.py — Accumulate live dashboard snapshots
#
# Each call to save_snapshot() appends one row per sensor to
# data/dashboard_snapshots.csv. These are live-pipeline snapshots taken while
# the Streamlit app or scripts/collector.py is running.
#
# Phase 4 training data is NOT collected here. The canonical training set is
# ml/data/history.csv, built by ml/training/collect_training_data.py from
# PurpleAir's historical API. Live snapshots and the training set live in
# separate files on purpose, so the training script can overwrite history.csv
# without corrupting the dashboard's accumulated state.
#
# Schema policy: the row schema is defined in exactly one place,
# `_build_snapshot_record`. The `COLUMNS` constant is *derived* from a
# placeholder call to that function so it cannot drift. `save_snapshot` then
# asserts that the in-memory DataFrame's columns match `COLUMNS`, so any
# accidental schema change is loud, not silent.
