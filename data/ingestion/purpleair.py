# data/ingestion/purpleair.py — PurpleAir sensor data ingestion
#
# Every PurpleAir reading returned by this module has been EPA-corrected at
# the source: pm25 is the corrected value, pm25_raw is the original laser-
# counter reading, and epa_corrected flags which rows had humidity available.
# Downstream code should treat pm25 as already corrected and NOT apply the
# formula again.
#
# The Barkjohn 2021 correction formula itself lives in data/corrections.py and
# is shared with the training pipeline (ml/training/collect_training_data.py)
# so both pipelines apply byte-identical math.
