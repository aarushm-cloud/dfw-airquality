Static spatial features derived from OpenStreetMap geometry.

The Phase 4 training pipeline needs spatial signals that can be computed
identically at inference time for IDW grid cells. Distance-to-nearest-highway
fits: it's a property of location alone (no time component, no API), so the
same lookup works for historical sensor rows AND live grid cells.
