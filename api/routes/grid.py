# Cache window for the assembled pipeline snapshot.

# Bumped from 300s to 1800s as part of the Phase 5 caching pass: at
# SAMPLE_GRID=5 (25 TomTom calls per refresh) and a 30-min TTL, daily
# usage caps at 48 × 25 = 1,200 calls — half of TomTom's 2,500/day shared
# free-tier limit, regardless of frontend traffic.
#
# app.py's Streamlit cache stays at 300s on purpose: that file is locked
# from modification (PROJECT_STATE.md), and Streamlit sessions are light
# and transient, so cache parity isn't worth the policy violation. Worst-
# case drift between the AERIA UI and the legacy Streamlit dashboard is
# ~25 minutes, which is fine since upstream sources refresh every
# 10–30 minutes anyway.
